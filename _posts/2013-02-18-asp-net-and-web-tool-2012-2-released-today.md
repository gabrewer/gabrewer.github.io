<p>The ASP.NET and Web Tools 2012.2 update was released today.&nbsp; There were many updates including some big additions like OData support and SignalR.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the things that jump out at me form the release notes.</p> <p>“Paste JSON as a .NET class. Using this Special Paste command to paste JSON into a C# or VB.NET code file, and Visual Studio will automatically generate .NET classes inferred from the JSON.”</p> <p>“Mobile Emulator support adds extensibility hooks so that third-party emulators can be installed as a VSIX. The installed emulators will show up in the F5 dropdown, so that developers can preview their websites on a variety of mobile devices.
