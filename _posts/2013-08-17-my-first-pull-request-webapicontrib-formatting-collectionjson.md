<p>In my latest project I am using the great <a href="http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/" target="_blank">Collection+Json</a> ASP.NET Web API <a href="http://amundsen.com/media-https://github.com/WebApiContrib/WebApiContrib.Formatting.CollectionJson" target="_blank">library</a> that Glenn Block put up on GitHub a while ago.&nbsp; After using it for a while I decided to refactor my code and use something other than an int for my type identifiers.&nbsp; When I changed to use the generic type, I discovered an issue with the code that had added the generic identifier capability to the library.&nbsp; The Create method was still retuning an int instead of the generic TId.</p> <p>So I wrote up the issue on GitHub and Glenn Block immediately responded asking if I was going to submit a Pull Request.&nbsp; I am still relatively new to git and am still trying to grok it.&nbsp; But since I had already forked the repository and updated the code, I figured this would be as good time as any to figure how to submit a pull request.&nbsp; </p> <p>Even though it was a one line change to the return type of the Create method, I realized that there were no unit tests for the CollectionJsonController class taking a generic identifier value.&nbsp; So I decided I should fix that as well and created a XUnit test for this scenario by cloning the existing tests with just a Controller that used a string for the identifier.&nbsp; Once I had the tests and the code working, I went about figure out how to submit my first pull request.</p> <p>I found an excellent resource that made the process relativity straight forward and painless.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.openshift.com/wiki/github-workflow-for-submitting-pull-requests">https://www.openshift.com/wiki/github-workflow-for-submitting-pull-requests</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>You can find my first pull request (modest as it may be) at</p> <p><a title="https://github.com/WebApiContrib/WebApiContrib.Formatting.CollectionJson/pull/12#issuecomment-22815387" href="https://github.com/WebApiContrib/WebApiContrib.Formatting.CollectionJson/pull/12#issuecomment-22815387">https://github.com/WebApiContrib/WebApiContrib.Formatting.CollectionJson/pull/12#issuecomment-22815387</a></p>
