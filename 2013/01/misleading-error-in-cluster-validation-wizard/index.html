<p>We had been using this same model of array in our Windows Server 2008 R2 clusters so we knew that the P2000 support SCSI-3 Persistent Reservations.&nbsp; So we went off to google it with bing to find the answer to what was happening with the Windows Server 2012 cluster.&nbsp; We found several posts on the HP support forums that had no solutions and found that HP had no VSS or VDS providers for the P2000 for Windows Server 2012 yet.&nbsp; (Which means no hardware snapshots with DPM yet)</p>
<p>Then we started to look at the warning more closely.&nbsp; One of things we realized was it was a warning and not an error.&nbsp; It seem like a SCSI-3 Persistent Reservation failure would have been a fatal error to the cluster validation error.&nbsp; Then we realized that there were two SCSI-3 Persistent Test in the Server 2012 Cluster validation tests.&nbsp; One was “Validate SCSI-3 Persistent Reservation” and the other was “Validate Storage Spaces Persistent Reservation”.&nbsp; The first one passed and it was the second one that failed. </p>
